# v4l_mfx_encoder

My attempt to build a seriously lightweight encoder for live streaming using V4L2 and Intel Quicksync, and work on a Intel NUC NUC5i7RYH.

It built for Magewell XI100DUSB, but should work with any capture card able to deliver YUYV422 RAW, or not.

The main aim is to make one optimized for twitch, that means 4Mbit, main profile, GOP 120, and optimized for gaming.
